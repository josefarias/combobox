> [!IMPORTANT]
> HotwireCombobox is at an early stage of development. It's nearing a beta release, but the API might change and bugs are expected. Please continue to use the library and report any issues in the GitHub repo.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "hotwire_combobox"
```

Then add the stylesheet to your layout:

```erb
<%= combobox_style_tag %>
```

Or require the styles with the asset pipeline in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

```erb
*= require hotwire_combobox
```

Only apps that use importmaps are currently supported. Support for other JS solutions is in progress.
